# Simple Calculator

A basic command-line calculator written in **Ruby** that performs fundamental arithmetic operations: **addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).**

## Features
- Accepts two numerical inputs.
- Supports four basic arithmetic operations.
- Handles division by zero gracefully.
- Provides error handling for invalid inputs.

## Prerequisites
- Ruby must be installed on your system. You can check by running:
  ```sh
  ruby -v
  ```
  If Ruby is not installed, download it from [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DragonKzWy/Calc.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Calc
   ```

## Usage
Run the calculator script with:
```sh
ruby calc.rb
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter two numbers and choose an operation.

## Example Interaction
```
Enter the first number:
10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /):
*
Enter the second number:
5
Result: 50.0
```

## Error Handling
- **Invalid operator:** Displays "Invalid operator!"
- **Division by zero:** Displays "Error: Division by zero is not allowed"
- **Non-numeric input:** Prompts the user to enter valid numbers
